# Personal Site - [nkress.dev](https://nkress.dev)
My personal website for portfolio, contact details and blog purposes.

## Built with
- [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
- [TypesScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

## Goals
- [x] Auto deploy through Github Actions CI
- [x] Zero cost hosting through Github Pages
- [x] Dynamic job title/employer, fetched from profile through Github API
- [x] Dyanmic 'working on' section, fetched from latest repo contributions through Github API
- [ ] Blog

## Troubleshooting
Note to self - if something doesn't work, upgrade Gatsby and other dependencies to the latest version... no matter how much you think it is unrelated.
